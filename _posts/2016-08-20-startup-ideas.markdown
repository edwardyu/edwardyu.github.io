As they say, startup ideas are worthless. I've decided to release my list of ideas that I've been keeping. 

**Idea:** Deep learning applied to summarizing audio 
**Notes:** Record lectures with a smartphone, get notes emailed to you. 

**Idea:** Quantum consulting service  
**Notes:** Wouldn't your business in 20 years need experts to implement quantum algorithms to optimize your work?

**Idea:** Internal StackOverflow for companies   
**Notes:** Companies have proprietary information and languages. This can be how programmers get help internally. 

**Idea:** App that visually represents the most important people in your life  
**Notes:**  Bubbles for each person grow and shrink based on how often you communicate with them. If you see people becoming smaller, maybe that’s a hint to contact them more often.

**Idea:** Take picture of item and get it shipped to your house  
**Notes:** Frictionless shopping.

**Idea:** Professional social networks based on endorsements. Only experts in a field can endorse others as experts.  
**Notes:** LinkedIn endorsements don't mean much. Seed the userbase with hand chosen experts in fields, and only they can vet others as experts in that particular field. 

**Idea:** Programming problems with ELO ratings, users also have ELO ratings  
**Notes:** Problems can adjust to your skill level.

**Idea:** AI personal assistant that can order food, book flights, etc.   
**Notes:** I came up with this before [Facebook M](http://www.wired.com/2015/08/facebook-launches-m-new-kind-virtual-assistant/) was a thing.

**Idea:** Random ticket purchasing service that gives you random event at a discount.  
**Notes:** Vendors need to sell seats at events, and you are not picky about what you want to do this weekend.

**Idea:** Deter shopaholics by making them wait a day before purchasing anything.  
**Notes:** A Chrome extension might work.

**Idea:** Reddit like site but you have to read the article before you can comment  
**Notes:** Perhaps with an AI generated quiz. This should allow for better discussion of articles.

**Idea:** Turnitin.com for code   
**Notes:** Catch those cheaters!

**Idea:** Backwards Kickstarter - crowdfund ideas and pay whoever builds it.  
**Notes:** I think I've seen this around somewhere, but I'm not sure where.

**Idea:** Website that lets people create MOOC degrees and course schedules  
**Notes:** MOOCs are great, but they have no continuity. This site should let people track their progress towards a virtual degree.

**Idea:** Unified messenger: Facebook, Text, Email, etc.  
**Notes:** Impossible without demanding people's passwords.

**Idea:** Service that redirects a link to the URL, or if the URL dies, the archived version of the URL.  
**Notes:** It's like goo.gl meets archive.org.

**Idea:** News service that emails you when a story is resolved  
**Notes:** Read once and forget is how I (and many Americans) approach news. 

**Idea:** Personalized Reddit based on what you upvote  
**Notes:** Perhaps as a newsfeed?

**Idea:** Crowdfunding lobbyists  
**Notes:** A platform for people to donate money to issues they care about. This money is then used to fund lobbyists in Washington, because [funding lobbyists has returns of 22000%](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/01/06/144737864/forget-stocks-or-bonds-invest-in-a-lobbyist).

**Idea:** Free mail delivery service, sponsored by ads.  
**Notes:** Send and receive letters for free.

**Idea:** Use bitcoin to mail people letters.  
**Notes:** Upload document, pay with bitcoin, send snail mail anonymously. 

**Idea:** Bookmarks for Quora answers  
**Notes:** Why don't they have this???

**Idea:** Sign up for $1 / day and get random ebay stuff shipped to you  
**Notes:** See [http://xkcd.com/576/](http://xkcd.com/576/). I've implemented this at [rrandomize.com](https://rrandomize.com)!

**Idea:** Stock market analysis via Twitter sentiment  
**Notes:** There are a lot of companies in this space.

**Idea:** Internet radio that plays the top song, sorted by votes  
**Notes:** Perhaps people at the same event can vote on what songs to play next.

**Idea:** Trade an email address for a file download  
**Notes:** Person that uploads content can build a subscriber list. 

**Idea:** A send feedback service similar to Google+’s  
**Notes:** One button to send feedback, with ability to highlight issues on a screenshot of the page you're seeing.

**Idea:** Get directions via text message.   
**Notes:** Implemented by Yahoo.
