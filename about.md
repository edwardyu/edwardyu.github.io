Hi, I'm Edward Yu. I'm currently Head of Quantitative Research at [Genesis Trading](https://genesistrading.com/), one of the largest crypto trading firms in the world. I joined Genesis after the acquisition of Qu Capital, a quantitative trading firm that I co-founded. Prior to that, I worked on data science at Facebook and was a ML researcher at Columbia's Data Science Institute. I graduated with a BS in applied mathematics from Columbia University in 2017. You may find some of the links below helpful. Contact me at [edwardy20@gmail.com](mailto:edwardy20@gmail.com).
