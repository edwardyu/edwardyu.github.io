<p class="message">
  Hello, I'm Edward Yu. I'm a builder at heart, and the founder of <a href="https://variational.io">Variational Research</a>, a technology firm building peer-to-peer decentralized derivatives. I'm interested in Bayesian statistics, machine learning/AI, quantitative trading, and decentralized applications.
<br><br>
  The cities in which I spend the most time these days are (in no particular order): New York, NY; Berkeley, CA; Taipei, Taiwan.

* 2021-Present: **[Variational Research](https://variational.io)** - I founded a protocol to enable bilateral derivatives on any underlying time series. We're a small team backed by venture capital. News: <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/322653/arbitrum-crypto-protocol-variational-funding">$10m seed raise by Bain Capital Crypto, Peak XV, Coinbase Ventures, Dragonfly, others.</a>
* 2019-2021: **Genesis Trading** - I was Head of Quantitative Research for one of the largest trading firms in crypto, doing market making on linear and options markets.

# Investing
My investing philosophy: many diversified alphas and a healthy dose of leverage.

I'm an angel investor in ~20 startups. I prefer seed stage or series A.
